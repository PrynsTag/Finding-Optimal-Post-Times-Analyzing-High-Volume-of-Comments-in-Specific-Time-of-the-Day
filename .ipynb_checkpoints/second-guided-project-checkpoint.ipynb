    "# Finding Optimal Post Times -- Analyzing High Volume of Comments in Specific Time of the Day\n",
    "We are analyzing the data set coming from the submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.\n",
    "Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "*This project will unveil wether if \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN\" receives more comments on average and use that to determine wether a specific time determines if the post receives more comments on average.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Result\n",
    "We have determined that `Ask HN` has the most post and we also determined that 3:00 pm in the afternoon is the peak time that users post comments in posts every day. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will be beneficial to users wanting an answer to their specific needs. Now they will have an idea what time to post a question to HackerNews and gain a lot of answers to their question.\n",
